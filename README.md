    <h1> <hr> HOBBIES </hr> </h1> 
    <p>This section tis to discuss my hobies.</p>
    <p> I have many hobbies that are all tied into varies jobs i have had or are working twoward.
    I am a swim coach that coaches at two highschools. I want to use some of what we learn in our
    data analtics class to streamling making their practices through a variety of metrics. Currently
    there are several practice generating software but none that can be as felxable as one would need 
    for a non cut highschool team that also has many USA swimmers on it. I am currently a substitue 
    teacher and ofen have to have technology help making lesson plans. Even though long term I want
    to teach ceramics full time I am slowly working towards my masters. In my free time I play board
    games with my friends and on my own will play games on my computer like Hades, Hallow Knight and 
    recently Marvel Rivals with some old college friends. </p>
